        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><strong>Why Rent Your Home?</strong></h2>
        <h4>Perhaps it’s not the right time to sell.</h4>
        <p>Market conditions may make selling an unappealing proposition. If you stand to lose money on your sale or can’t afford months of vacancy, leasing is an attractive alternative to selling.</p>
        <h4>You’re leaving the area but might return.</h4>
        <p>Leasing your home will give you the flexibility to return to the area later on.</p>
        <h4>Cash flow and investment.</h4>
        <p>Your home is an investment that can provide cash flow, tax benefits and a handsome return in the future.</p>

        <p>Being a landlord, especially an “out of town” landlord can be a scary proposition for many people. Advertising, showing, Saturday night maintenance emergencies, late rent, etc. can easily become overwhelming. Worries about how tenants care for your property can easily cause sleepless nights.</p>
